                I finally got the orientation right and choose/squatted on the correct seat to view the sea. It's nice here. Not too cold. 

                The driver is drinking an energy drink called Hell. He does not speak Italian but English. I think he is from Hungary.  
                
                Me and Salik like this place more than Treviso. But Treviso has its charm. I saw people jogging beside the sea. Very refreshing. You feel younger here while in Treviso is more settled and still.
                
                Trieste deserves a second visit probably enroute croatia in summer.
